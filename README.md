### About Dataset
Masks play a crucial role in protecting the health of individuals against respiratory diseases, as is one of the few precautions available for COVID-19 in the absence of immunization. With this dataset, it is possible to create a model to detect people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing masks improperly.
This dataset contains 853 images belonging to the 3 classes, as well as their bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format.
The classes are:

    With mask
    Without mask
    Mask worn incorrectly

#### Dataset dstribution:
we split our dataset in two set.Such as:

       Train dataset
       Validation dataset
       

Train dataset contained 0.80(80% of the entrire dataset)

Validation dataset contained 0.20(20% of the entire dataset)

## Motivation

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing face masks became a crucial preventive measure to limit the spread of the virus. However, ensuring proper mask usage in public spaces remains a challenge. This project aims to leverage deep learning and computer vision to create an end-to-end face mask detection system that can accurately identify whether a person is wearing a mask correctly, wearing it incorrectly, or not wearing one at all.

By integrating YOLO for real-time detection, Flask for web deployment, and ONNX for optimized model inference, this project provides a fast, reliable, and scalable solution for monitoring mask compliance. The goal is to contribute towards public health safety by automating mask detection in various environments such as workplaces, malls, and public transport systems. 

This repository documents the complete pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment, making it a valuable resource for those interested in AI-driven computer vision applications. 

## problem 
I deploy this project in render cloud, which is free. The render cannot load  to run the webcam and some time stuck in internal server error . So if you want to  run my web service, please! run it locally by cloning my repo.
